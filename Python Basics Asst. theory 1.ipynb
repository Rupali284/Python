    "Numeric data type represent the data which has numeric value. It can be integer, floating number or complex numbers. \n",
    "These values are defined as int, float and complex class in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Integers: It is respresented as int class. It Contains positive or negative whole numbers.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Float: It is represented as float class. It is a real number with floating point representation andspecified by a decimal point\n",

    "\n",
    "2.Lists:\n",
    "Lists are just like the arrays, declared in other languages which is an ordered collection of data. \n",
    "It is very flexible as the items in a list do not need to be of the same type.\n",
    "Lists in Python can be created by just placing the sequence inside the square brackets[]. \n",
    " \n",
    "3.Tuples:\n",
    "Just like list, tuple is also an ordered collection of Python objects. \n",
    "The only difference between type and list is that tuples are immutable i.e. tuples cannot be modified after it is created. \n",
    "It is represented by tuple class. \n",
    "Tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping of \n",
    "the data sequence.\n",
    "Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, list, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Boolean:\n",
    "Data type with one of the two built-in values, True or False.\n",
    "Boolean objects that are equal to True are truthy (true), and those equal to False are falsy (false).\n",
    "But non-Boolean objects can be evaluated in Boolean context as well and determined to be true or false.\n",
